Who is AWS developer?
AWS Developer is responsible for designing, deploying, and developing cloud applications on AWS platform.

What is AWS cloud Infrastructure?
need to deploy your application workloads across the globe in a single click.
deploy specific applications closer to your end-users.

what is AWS regions?
cluster of data centres. and data centers are nothing but  Availability zones.

what is AWS AZ's ?
An Availability Zone (AZ) is one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking,
and connectivity in an AWS Region.

why concept of AZ's?
All AZâ€™s in an AWS Region are interconnected with high-bandwidth, low-latency networking.
for customers who need for low fault tolerance and low latency.

what is AWS Local Zones?
are places which provides  compute, storage, database, and other select AWS services closer to end-users.

what is AWS Wavelength?
use of bandwidth and latency advancements of 5G.

what is AWS service?
global cloud-based products including compute, storage, database, analytics, networking, machine learning
and AI, mobile, developer tools, IoT, security, enterprise applications, and much more.

What is EC2 instance?
is a virtual server which we are using for our application.

what is SSH key?
is a password for our created instance.

SSH works on?
mac and linux.

what is EC2 instance connect?
allows us to connect to our instance through a web browser which is running on a OS.

what is SSH ?
functionality allows us to connect to remote machine through command line.

How to SSH into your EC2 instance?   for MAC OS
step 1 : already saved IPv4 IP Address , get it copied when you create it for first time.
step 2 : note down the port as well
step 3 : go on terminal of your local machine
step 4 : ssh ec2-user@35.180.100.144
       : part before @ is computer user on your AWS machine
       : part after @ is IPv4 address
step 5 : continue ? yes
step 6 : now go inside the folder which contains SSH key and
       : ssh -i EC2Tutorial.pem  ec2-user@35.180.100.144
       : here EC2Tutorial.pem is a file containing key.
step 7 : unprotected private key will appear
step 8 : chmod 0400 EC2Tutorial.pem
step 9 : https://aws.amazon.com/......   will appear.


why unprotected private key error?
when we create instance for first time then key will be generated and downloadable.
now permission to this file is 0644 meaning anyone access this file.
so change access permission to 0400 meaning only you can access this file.

how to logout from my AWS instance?
control D

SSH There's a connection timeout
: security group must have a port range of instance.

SSH There's a connection refused
: restart the instance. if doesn't work, create a new one.

SSH Permission denied (publickey,gssapi-keyex,gssapi-with-mic)
:wrong security key or wrong user.
:Make sure you have started an Amazon Linux 2 EC2 instance, and make sure you're using the user ec2-user.



why EC2 IP address is changed on stop and start?
As per AWS, when an instance is launched in EC2-Classic, it is automatically assigned a public IP address to
the instance from the EC2-Classic public IPv4 address pool.
so when we stop the instance the IP is returned to pool so that it can be used by any other
instance.

what is stop and start?
Stop and Restart - When you stop a server in RightScale, the associated instance is actually
terminated. Therefore, when you restart the server, another virtual machine instance will
be provisioned to you,so it will have new and different public(unless it was allocated an
elastic ip) and private IP addresses.

what is relaunch?
Relaunch - When you relaunch a server, the running instance is terminated and a new instance
is launched in its place.

what is reboot?
Reboot - When you perform a reboot, the same virtual machine instance is rebooted. The original
virtual machine instance that was provisioned to you is never returned back to Amazon.
The public IP address will not change.


why EBS volume is locked to an AZ only?
Possible reason to this is because of the fact that EBS Volumes are present outside of the host
machine and instances have to be connected over the network, if the EBS Volumes are present outside
the Availability Zone there can be potential latency issues and subsequent performance degradation.
